# Deployment Guide — Credits

Two paths through this guide:
- **[Run it on your own computer](#run-it-on-your-own-computer)** — for trying it out or developing
- **[Deploy it to a real server](#deploy-it-to-a-real-server)** — for actually putting it in front of users

Both need the same three pieces: a PostgreSQL database, the FastAPI backend, and the React frontend.

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | What it's for |
|---|---|---|
| Python | 3.11+ (3.14 supported) | Runs the backend |
| Node.js | 18+ | Builds the frontend |
| PostgreSQL | 14+ | Stores the data |
| Git | any | Getting the code |

---

## Run it on your own computer

### 1. Create the database

```bash
# Install PostgreSQL if you don't have it:
#   macOS:  brew install postgresql@16 && brew services start postgresql@16
#   Ubuntu: sudo apt install postgresql && sudo systemctl start postgresql

createdb credits_db
psql -d credits_db -f database/schema.sql
psql -d credits_db -f database/seed.sql   # optional — adds sample teachers/classes so the app isn't empty
```

### 2. Start the backend

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and fill in:
#   DATABASE_URL  — should already match the database you just created
#   SECRET_KEY    — generate one with: python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

python3 preflight_check.py      # catches config mistakes before you start the server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The backend is now running at `http://localhost:8000` — API docs are at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### 3. Start the frontend

In a **second terminal**:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`. It automatically talks to the backend on port 8000 (configured in `vite.config.js`).

### 4. Log in for the first time

1. Username `admin`, password `admin`.
2. You'll be forced to set a real username and password immediately — that's intentional, the dashboard stays locked until you do.
3. Go to **Calendar & Day Order** and add at least one Academic Year, Semester, and a few working days with Day Orders assigned. Leave requests and timetable entries are rejected for any date that hasn't been marked on the calendar yet — this is the most common "why isn't this working" moment for a fresh install.

That's it — you have a working local copy.

---

## Deploy it to a real server

### Option A — Automated script (Linux)

If you're deploying to a fresh Ubuntu/Debian server, `scripts/deploy_linux.sh` does steps 1-6 below for you in one go: installs dependencies, creates the database, generates a secret key, builds the frontend, and sets up Nginx + a systemd service.

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> credits-system
cd credits-system
sudo bash scripts/deploy_linux.sh
```

Read through the script first if you want to understand what it's doing — it assumes a single server running everything (database, backend, frontend) together. The manual steps below are what it automates, useful if you're deploying differently (managed database, separate frontend host, Docker, etc).

A Windows equivalent, `scripts/deploy_windows.bat`, handles local setup but not full production hosting (Windows Server deployments vary too much to script generically) — use it to prep the environment, then follow the manual steps for actually serving the app.

### Option B — Manual steps

**1. Set up the database.** Either a managed provider (Render, Railway, Supabase, RDS, etc.) or self-hosted:

```sql
-- Self-hosted: create a dedicated, limited-privilege app user
CREATE USER credits_app WITH PASSWORD 'use-a-strong-password-here';
CREATE DATABASE credits_db OWNER credits_app;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE credits_db TO credits_app;
```

```bash
psql "<your-connection-string>" -f database/schema.sql
# Do NOT run seed.sql here — it creates demo accounts you don't want in production.
```

Upgrading an existing installation instead of starting fresh? Run whichever migrations bring you up to date:
```bash
psql -d credits_db -f database/migrations/002_add_rbac_and_audit.sql   # from v1
psql -d credits_db -f database/migrations/003_academic_calendar.sql    # from v2
```

**2. Run the backend with a real server process** (not `--reload`, which is dev-only):

```bash
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn app.main:app -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -b 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Before going live, update CORS in `backend/app/main.py` (or via the `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` setting — see `.env.example`) to your real frontend domain instead of `localhost`.

Prefer containers? A minimal Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["gunicorn", "app.main:app", "-w", "4", "-k", "uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker", "-b", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

**3. Build and serve the frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build   # outputs static files to frontend/dist/
```

Serve `frontend/dist/` and proxy `/api/*` to the backend from the same Nginx host, so the frontend's existing relative API path keeps working unchanged:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    root /var/www/credits/dist;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri /index.html;
    }

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
```

(Hosting frontend and backend on separate domains instead? Change `baseURL` in `frontend/src/api/client.js` to the backend's full URL and rebuild.)

**4. Add HTTPS** once your domain points at the server:
```bash
sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
sudo systemctl enable certbot.timer   # auto-renewal
```

## Environment variables reference

| Variable | What it does | Example / default |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Where the database lives | `postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/credits_db` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Signs login tokens — **must** be long and random in production | generate with `python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"` |
| `ALGORITHM` | Token signing algorithm | `HS256` |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` | How long someone stays logged in | `60` |
| `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` / `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` / `VAPID_CONTACT_EMAIL` | Optional — enables browser push notifications | leave blank to disable |
| `PERIODS_PER_DAY` | How many class periods exist in a day | `5` |
| `DAY_ORDER_MAX` | How many Day Orders the rotation cycles through | `6` |
| `APP_NAME` | Shown on the login screen, sidebar, and browser tab | `Credits` |
| `PRIMARY_COLOR` | Accent color used throughout the UI | `#4f46e5` |
| `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` | Which domain is allowed to call the backend (CORS) | `http://localhost:5173` |
| `MAX_SECONDARY_ADMINS` | Cap on how many Secondary Admin accounts can exist | `3` |

`PERIODS_PER_DAY` and `DAY_ORDER_MAX` only change validation in the application — the database also enforces these ranges at a lower level as a safety net, and widening that requires an actual migration. See `database/README.md` if you need to change these for real, not just the defaults.

The frontend needs no `.env` for local development — Vite's proxy handles routing automatically.

## Post-deployment checklist

- [ ] `SECRET_KEY` is unique and at least 32 characters — not the placeholder from `.env.example`
- [ ] `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` / CORS is set to your real domain, not `localhost`
- [ ] `seed.sql` was **not** run against this database
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled on both frontend and backend
- [ ] Database backups are scheduled
- [ ] At least one Academic Year, Semester, and some working days with Day Orders exist before anyone tries to apply for leave or build a timetable
- [ ] `backend/backups/` and `backend/logs/` exist and are writable (Factory Reset needs them)

## If something goes wrong

**`pip install` fails on Python 3.13/3.14** — see the Troubleshooting section in `README.md`; the short version is `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt` to make sure you're getting current package releases, not stale cached ones.

**Backend won't start / config errors** — run `python3 preflight_check.py` from inside `backend/`. It checks your `.env`, database connection, and schema before you waste time chasing a confusing stack trace.

**Locked out of the admin account entirely** — `cd backend && python3 scripts/factory_reset.py`. This wipes all data and resets to the bootstrap `admin`/`admin` login, so only use it as a last resort. A backup is written automatically first.

**Anything else** — `README.md` has a fuller troubleshooting section, and `database/README.md` covers schema/migration-specific issues.
